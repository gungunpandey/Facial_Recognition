This repository contains a facial recognition model built using a Siamese network architecture.
Features:
1) Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a Siamese neural network for high-accuracy facial recognition.
2) Batchwise Training: Trains on batches of images to learn a similarity function, making it robust to variations in lighting, angle, and expression.
3) Easy Integration: The model can be easily integrated into existing applications for authentication, security, or other use cases.
4) For achritecture i referred to the paper on Siamese Neural Networks for One-Shot image recognition by Gregory Koch, Richard Zemel and Ruslan Salakhutdinov
5) link of paper: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf
